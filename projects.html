          <h3>Austin, TX</h3>
          <p>
            The St. Elmo Market project is located on thriving South Congress Avenue in the emerging St. Elmo District
            of Austin, Texas.  The market is part of a major planned mix use development that includes a hotel, residential,
            office, and structured parking.  As currently envisioned, St. Elmo Market will be approximately 40,000 square feet
            and will feature a variety of popular Austin artisan food purveyors. In addition, we are in final negotiations
            with the creators and entrepreneurs behind a novel and exciting restaurant and food service incubator concept,
            currently operating in Brooklyn, NY, and set to expand to the Austin area. The Carlin Company is functioning as
            Market Advisor, responsible for guiding the development team and consultants on design, merchandising, leasing,
            management, marketing, and ongoing profitable operations.

          <h3>Everett, WA</h3>
          <p>
            Located approximately 30 minutes north of downtown Seattle, Grand Avenue Marketplace combines local artisan producers,
            growers, and restaurants on the ground floor of a 220 unit residential tower. The inclusion of high ceilings and the
            long wooden “cloud” nave through the market hall, sets the tone for this ideal Pacific Northwest maritime marketplace
            setting. The project is anchored by Farms &amp; Market, a proprietary farm-based kitchen café concept created by Carlin Company.
             The entire marketplace is approximately 40,000 square feet, with Farms and Market occupying some 7,000 square feet.
             The Carlin Company is acting as development manager for the retail ground floor and is responsible for planning,
             implementation, and overseeing the successful opening and profitable operations going forward.
