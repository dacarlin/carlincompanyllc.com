            <p>“I was an early convert – as both a consumer and vendors’ representative - to the Public Market concept as realized in the San Francisco Ferry Building (where I worked across the street for a number of years), and the Oxbow Public Market near my home in Napa.  I have seen first-hand the ways that a public market fundamentally enriches a community.  I am absolutely thrilled to have the opportunity to bring this concept to communities throughout North America.”   </p>
